# BUILD COMMUNITY DRIVEN SOFTWARE PROJECTS ON GITHUB

## INTRODUCTION TO GITHUB

- GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git at its core. It simplifies the process of collaborating on projects and provides a website, command-line tools, and overall flow that allows developers and users to work together
- It can also be used to build, scale, and deliver secure software
    - GitHub Enterprise Platform includes security features that minimize security risk and the code remains private within your organization. You are able to take advantage of security overview and Dependabot

- Repositories contains all of the project's files and each file's revision history
    - Private repositories are only accessible to you, people you explicitly share access with, and for organization repositories certain organization members

- To add files to a repository on GitHub you must first have minimum Write access within the repository to which you want to add the file. To create a file inside subdirectories use `/` separator inside filename area
    - Commit message should describe the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than 1 author in the commit message
    - Always push changes to a new branch and then create a pull request to merge the pushed changes into the main branch

- Similar to repositories, gists are simplified way to share code snippets with others. Every gist is a Git repository, which you can fork and clone and be made either public or secret. PUblic gists are displayed publicly where people can browser new ones as they are created. Public gists are also searchable. Conversely, secret gists aren't searchable, but they aren't entirely private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it. See [Creating Gists](https://www.creatinggists.com)

- Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project (such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles). While a README file quickly tells what your project can do, you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation. For a private repository, only people who have at least read access to your repository will have access to the wiki
